## Place Entities (AUTHORITATIVE — pre-classified from BHSA)

The following entities have been classified as places by the BHSA linguistic \
database (via the `nametype` feature). Each entity includes: name, english_gloss, \
entity_type, entry_verse, exit_verse, appears_in, and appearance_count.

{place_entities}

Generate the remaining sections:

1. **Theological Spine**: 2-4 paragraphs describing the theological arc of the book. \
How does God act? What theological themes run through the narrative? What is the book's \
contribution to the canon?

2. **Places**: Create an entry for EACH place entity listed above. \
All entities have already been classified as places — do not skip any.
For each place:
- name: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- english_gloss: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- entity_type: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- first_appears: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data (use entry_verse)
- type: city, region, field, country, etc.
- meaning_and_function: The place's significance in the narrative
- appears_in: Copy the ENTIRE appears_in list EXACTLY from the entity data
- appearance_count: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data

CRITICAL: The name, english_gloss, entity_type, first_appears, appears_in, and \
appearance_count fields are static and MUST match the entity data exactly. \
Do NOT invent places not in the list.

3. **Objects**: Significant physical objects, animals, or temporal markers from the text. \
These are typically NOT proper nouns, so they won't be in the entity list. \
For each: name, first_appears, what_it_is, meaning_across_scenes, appears_in.

4. **Institutions**: Cultural/legal institutions referenced in the text. \
These are typically NOT proper nouns, so they won't be in the entity list. \
For each: name, first_invoked (chapter/verse), what_it_is, role_in_book, appears_in.

5. **Genre Context**:
- primary_genre: The primary literary genre
- sub_genres: List of secondary genres present
- narrative_voice: Description of the narrative perspective
- temporal_setting: When the events take place
- audience_positioning: How the text positions the reader/listener

6. **Maintenance Notes**:
- generation_notes: Brief note about how this document was generated
- known_limitations: List of known limitations or areas that may need human review
