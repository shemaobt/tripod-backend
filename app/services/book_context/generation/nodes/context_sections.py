## Place Entities (AUTHORITATIVE — pre-classified from BHSA)

The following entities have been classified as places by the BHSA linguistic \
database (via the `nametype` feature). Each entity includes: name, english_gloss, \
entity_type, entry_verse, exit_verse, appears_in, and appearance_count.

{place_entities}

## Common Noun Candidates (BHSA-extracted: substantives, adjectives, verbs)

The following common-noun lemmas (and verbs) were extracted from the BHSA. Use \
this list to (a) find COMMON-NOUN PLACES (e.g. field, gate, threshing floor), \
(b) anchor OBJECTS to specific Hebrew lemmas, and (c) anchor INSTITUTIONS to \
verbal lemmas of institutional actions (e.g. גאל "redeem", לקט "glean"). Each \
candidate has: lemma, lemma_ascii, english_gloss, sp ("subs"/"adjv"/"verb"), \
appearance_count, top_functions, top_binyans, first_appears, sample_appears_in.

{common_nouns}

Generate the remaining sections:

1. **Theological Spine**: 2-4 paragraphs describing the theological arc of the book. \
How does God act? What theological themes run through the narrative? What is the book's \
contribution to the canon?

2. **Places**: Two sources.
(a) For EACH proper-noun place entity in the list above, create an entry: \
- name: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- english_gloss: Copy from the entity data. If empty, provide the English \
translation of the Hebrew name.
- entity_type: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data ("place")
- first_appears: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data (use entry_verse)
- type: city, region, field, country, etc.
- meaning_and_function: The place's significance in the narrative
- appears_in: Copy the ENTIRE appears_in list EXACTLY from the entity data
- appearance_count: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data
The static fields (name, english_gloss, entity_type, first_appears, appears_in, \
appearance_count) MUST match the entity data exactly. Do NOT invent proper-noun \
places not in the list.

(b) Additionally, you MAY add COMMON-NOUN PLACES (field, gate, threshing floor, \
city wall, etc.) drawn from the Common Noun Candidates above when they function \
as narrative settings. For these:
- name: the Hebrew lemma (lemma) from the candidate
- english_gloss: the candidate's english_gloss
- entity_type: "place_common"
- first_appears: copy from candidate's first_appears
- appears_in: copy from candidate's sample_appears_in
- appearance_count: copy from candidate's appearance_count
- type, meaning_and_function: your scholarly enrichment.
For source (b), you MUST select from the Common Noun Candidates list — do NOT \
invent common-noun places outside the list.

3. **Objects**: Significant physical objects, animals, or temporal markers from the text. \
For each: name (in Hebrew if the original text uses a Hebrew term), english_gloss \
(English translation of the name — if the name is already English, repeat it), \
first_appears, what_it_is, meaning_across_scenes, appears_in. \
PREFERRED: when a candidate from the Common Noun Candidates list matches an object \
you would identify (e.g. sandal, grain, garment), use the candidate's lemma as `name`, \
copy `english_gloss`, `first_appears`, and `appears_in` from the candidate. The \
ability to infer objects from narrative context remains.

4. **Institutions**: Cultural/legal/religious institutions referenced in the text. \
For each: name (in Hebrew if the original text uses a Hebrew term), english_gloss \
(English translation of the name — if the name is already English, repeat it), \
first_invoked (chapter/verse), what_it_is, role_in_book, appears_in. \
PREFERRED: when an institution corresponds to a verbal lemma in the candidates \
(e.g. גאל "redeem" → kinsman-redemption institution; לקט "glean" → gleaning rights), \
use the verbal lemma to anchor the entry with richer attestation. \
You may also include institutions implicit in the narrative even when no single \
lemma names them (e.g. levirate marriage in Ruth 4).

5. **Genre Context**:
- primary_genre: The primary literary genre
- sub_genres: List of secondary genres present
- narrative_voice: Description of the narrative perspective
- temporal_setting: When the events take place
- audience_positioning: How the text positions the reader/listener

6. **Maintenance Notes**:
- generation_notes: Brief note about how this document was generated
- known_limitations: List of known limitations or areas that may need human review
