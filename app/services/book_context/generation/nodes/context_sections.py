## Place Entities (AUTHORITATIVE — pre-classified from BHSA)

The following entities have been classified as places by the BHSA linguistic \
database (via the `nametype` feature). Each entity includes: name, english_gloss, \
entity_type, entry_verse, exit_verse, appears_in, and appearance_count.

{place_entities}

## Common Noun Candidates (AUTHORITATIVE — BHSA-extracted lemmas)

The following lemmas were extracted directly from the BHSA. They are the ONLY \
source from which common-noun places, objects and institutions may be drawn. \
Each candidate includes: lemma, lemma_ascii, english_gloss, sp \
("subs"/"adjv"/"verb"), appearance_count, top_functions, top_binyans, \
first_appears, sample_appears_in.

{common_nouns}

## Output Rules (BHSA-strict)

You MUST produce common-noun places, objects and institutions ONLY by selecting \
candidates from the list above. You MUST NOT invent entries that lack a BHSA \
lemma anchor. Your scholarly enrichment is restricted to the descriptive fields \
explicitly listed for each task (e.g. `meaning_and_function`, `what_it_is`, \
`role_in_book`, `display_name`).

You MUST NOT include in `objects` or `institutions` any lemma that already \
appears in the participant register with `entity_type == "person_common"` \
(human collective groups, kinship categories, institutional roles/offices). \
Those belong only in the participant register; do not duplicate them here.

Generate the following sections:

1. **Theological Spine**: 2-4 paragraphs describing the theological arc of the book. \
How does God act? What theological themes run through the narrative? What is the book's \
contribution to the canon?

2. **Places**: Two sources.
(a) For EACH proper-noun place entity in the Place Entities list above, create an entry:
- name: copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- english_gloss: copy from the entity data. If empty, provide the English \
translation of the Hebrew name.
- entity_type: copy EXACTLY from the entity data ("place")
- first_appears: copy EXACTLY from the entity data (use entry_verse)
- type: city, region, field, country, etc. (your scholarly classification)
- meaning_and_function: the place's significance in the narrative (1-2 sentences)
- appears_in: copy the ENTIRE appears_in list EXACTLY from the entity data
- appearance_count: copy EXACTLY from the entity data
You MUST NOT invent proper-noun places outside the entity list.

(b) For EACH candidate in the Common Noun Candidates list whose `sp == "subs"` \
and whose semantics denote a NARRATIVE SETTING (field, gate, threshing floor, \
city wall, road, vineyard, etc.), create an entry:
- name: the Hebrew lemma (the `lemma` field) — copy EXACTLY
- english_gloss: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `english_gloss`
- entity_type: "place_common"
- first_appears: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `first_appears`
- appears_in: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `sample_appears_in`
- appearance_count: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `appearance_count`
- type: city / region / field / threshing_floor / gate / etc. (your scholarly \
classification of the lemma's semantic type)
- meaning_and_function: your scholarly enrichment in 1-2 sentences
You MUST NOT invent common-noun places outside the candidate list. Skip \
candidates whose semantics do not denote a narrative setting (those go to other \
sections).

3. **Objects**: For EACH candidate in the Common Noun Candidates list whose \
`sp == "subs"` and whose semantics fall into ONE of these classes, create \
an entry:

  (a) PHYSICAL OBJECT — ritual items, garments, tools, animals, monetary \
units, scrolls/letters, weapons, food and drink items, containers, \
agricultural products, body adornments
  (b) SYMBOLIC ITEM with narrative weight in the book (e.g., gallows as \
sign of judgment, sandal as legal exchange token, ashes as mourning sign)
  (c) NARRATIVE STATE OR CONDITION that recurs as a plot anchor \
(e.g., pregnancy/offspring when it drives the narrative, rest/security \
as a sought-after outcome, life as a recurring concern). Include this \
class ONLY when the lemma is referenced multiple times AND functions as \
a narrative thread, not when it is a passing abstraction.

For each entry:
- name: the Hebrew lemma (the `lemma` field) — copy EXACTLY
- display_name: A rich, narrative-faithful English name when scholarly \
tradition has one (e.g., a recurring ceremonial garment may be known by a \
canonical English label; a distinctive item central to the plot may have \
a culturally-known name in English biblical scholarship). Leave empty when \
the english_gloss is already self-explanatory and adding a label would be \
artificial.
- english_gloss: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `english_gloss`
- first_appears: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `first_appears`
- appears_in: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `sample_appears_in`
- what_it_is: 1-2 sentences describing what the object/state is
- meaning_across_scenes: 2-3 sentences on how its role evolves in the narrative

Skip generic temporal markers (day, night, month, year) UNLESS they carry \
distinctive narrative or symbolic weight in this specific book. Skip body \
parts UNLESS they appear in a ritual or symbolic action central to the \
narrative. Skip purely theological abstractions (God's name, righteousness \
as a virtue, glory) — those belong in `theological_spine` or as \
institutions when they name a recognized structure. You MUST NOT invent \
objects outside the candidate list.

4. **Institutions**: For EACH candidate in the Common Noun Candidates list \
that denotes a CULTURAL, LEGAL, RELIGIOUS, OR CEREMONIAL STRUCTURE — NOT a \
human role/title (those go to participants as `type=role`). This includes:
  - Rituals and rites (e.g., feast, fast, festival, mourning rite, sealing)
  - Legal practices (e.g., redemption rights, gleaning rights, levirate \
marriage, decree, inheritance law)
  - Social structures as institutions (e.g., kinship clan as an institutional \
unit, kingship as an office, priesthood as an order)

Verbal lemmas (`sp == "verb"`) that name an institutional action (e.g., a \
verb of redemption, gleaning, sealing, fasting) are eligible. Substantive \
lemmas (`sp == "subs"`) naming the rite/concept itself are eligible. Skip \
candidates that are merely a human title or office (those belong in \
participants).

For each entry:
- name: the Hebrew lemma (the `lemma` field) — copy EXACTLY
- display_name: A rich, narrative-faithful English name in the form scholarly \
tradition uses (e.g., a culturally-recognized festival name, a legal-practice \
label, an institutional office name). The display_name should be readable to \
a Bible translator who does not read Hebrew (e.g., "Festival of Purim", \
"Kinsman-Redemption (Go'el)", "Levirate Marriage", "Persian Law / Irrevocable \
Decree"). Leave empty only when the english_gloss already serves as a \
recognized institutional name on its own.
- english_gloss: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `english_gloss`
- first_invoked: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `first_appears`
- appears_in: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `sample_appears_in`
- what_it_is: 1-2 sentences describing the institution
- role_in_book: 1-2 sentences on its narrative function

You MUST NOT invent institutions outside the candidate list. Inferred \
institutions without a BHSA lemma anchor are NOT permitted.

5. **Genre Context**:
- primary_genre: The primary literary genre
- sub_genres: List of secondary genres present
- narrative_voice: Description of the narrative perspective
- temporal_setting: When the events take place
- audience_positioning: How the text positions the reader/listener

6. **Maintenance Notes**:
- generation_notes: Brief note about how this document was generated
- known_limitations: List of known limitations or areas that may need human review
