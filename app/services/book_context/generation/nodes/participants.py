PARTICIPANT_PROMPT = """\
You are a biblical scholar creating a participant register for {book_name}.

Structural outline of the book:
{outline}

BHSA linguistic data summary:
{bhsa_summary}

## Person Entities (AUTHORITATIVE — pre-classified from BHSA)

The following entities have been classified as persons/groups by the BHSA linguistic \
database (via the `nametype` feature). Each entity includes: name, english_gloss, \
entity_type, entry_verse, exit_verse, appears_in, and appearance_count.

{person_entities}

## Common Noun Candidates (BHSA-extracted substantives — for groups/roles only)

The following common nouns were extracted from the BHSA. Inspect this list to \
identify HUMAN COLLECTIVE ROLES that participate in the narrative as groups (e.g. \
elders, women of Bethlehem, reapers, servants, kinsmen). Each candidate includes: \
lemma (Hebrew), lemma_ascii, english_gloss, sp ("subs" / "adjv" / "verb"), \
appearance_count, top_functions, first_appears, sample_appears_in.

ONLY substantives (`sp == "subs"`) referring to human roles/groups should become \
participant entries from this list. Verbs and abstract substantives must be \
ignored here (they are processed in other sections of the document).

{common_nouns}

## Your Task

Produce participant entries from BOTH sources above:

### Source A — Person Entities (proper nouns)
Create an entry for EACH person entity listed above. \
All entities have already been classified as persons — do not skip any.

For each participant:
- name: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- english_gloss: Copy from the entity data. If empty, provide the English \
translation of the Hebrew name.
- entity_type: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- type: "named" for individuals, "group" for groups, "divine" for God/YHWH
- entry_verse: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data (do NOT change)
- exit_verse: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data (do NOT change)
- appears_in: Copy the ENTIRE appears_in list EXACTLY from the entity data
- appearance_count: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- role_in_book: Their narrative role (protagonist, antagonist, supporting, etc.)
- relationships: List of relationship descriptions
- what_audience_knows_at_entry: What the audience knows when they first appear
- arc: List of {{at: {{chapter, verse}}, state: "description"}} tracking their development
- status_at_end: Their state at the book's conclusion

### Source B — Common Noun Groups/Roles
For each substantive candidate above that denotes a HUMAN COLLECTIVE ROLE \
narratively significant in the book, add a participant entry with:
- name: the Hebrew lemma (lemma field) from the candidate
- english_gloss: the candidate's english_gloss
- entity_type: "person_common"
- type: "group"
- entry_verse: copy from candidate's first_appears
- exit_verse: leave null
- appears_in: copy from candidate's sample_appears_in
- appearance_count: copy from candidate's appearance_count
- role_in_book, relationships, what_audience_knows_at_entry, arc, status_at_end: \
your scholarly enrichment based on the narrative.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. For Source A: create an entry for EVERY person entity in the list — do NOT skip any.
2. For Source A: do NOT invent new proper-noun participants not in the list. \
The name, english_gloss, entity_type, entry_verse, exit_verse, appears_in, \
and appearance_count MUST be copied exactly — these are static fields.
3. For Source B: you MUST select from the Common Noun Candidates list — \
do NOT invent groups/roles not in the list. Only include candidates that \
clearly denote human collective roles (skip objects, places, abstract concepts, verbs).
4. Your enrichment for both sources is limited to: type, role_in_book, \
relationships, what_audience_knows_at_entry, arc, and status_at_end.
