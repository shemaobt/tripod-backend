PARTICIPANT_PROMPT = """\
You are a biblical scholar creating a participant register for {book_name}.

Structural outline of the book:
{outline}

BHSA linguistic data summary:
{bhsa_summary}

## Person Entities (AUTHORITATIVE — pre-classified from BHSA)

The following entities have been classified as persons/groups by the BHSA linguistic \
database (via the `nametype` feature). Each entity includes: name, english_gloss, \
entity_type, entry_verse, exit_verse, appears_in, and appearance_count.

{person_entities}

## Your Task

Create a participant entry for EACH person entity listed above. \
All entities have already been classified as persons — do not skip any.

For each participant:
- name: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- english_gloss: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- entity_type: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- type: "named" for individuals, "group" for groups, "divine" for God/YHWH
- entry_verse: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data (do NOT change)
- exit_verse: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data (do NOT change)
- appears_in: Copy the ENTIRE appears_in list EXACTLY from the entity data
- appearance_count: Copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- role_in_book: Their narrative role (protagonist, antagonist, supporting, etc.)
- relationships: List of relationship descriptions
- what_audience_knows_at_entry: What the audience knows when they first appear
- arc: List of {{at: {{chapter, verse}}, state: "description"}} tracking their development
- status_at_end: Their state at the book's conclusion

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Create an entry for EVERY person entity in the list — do NOT skip any.
2. Do NOT invent new participants not in the list.
3. The name, english_gloss, entity_type, entry_verse, exit_verse, appears_in, \
and appearance_count MUST be copied exactly — these are static fields.
4. Your enrichment is limited to: type, role_in_book, relationships, \
what_audience_knows_at_entry, arc, and status_at_end.
