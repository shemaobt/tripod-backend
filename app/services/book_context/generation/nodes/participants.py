PARTICIPANT_PROMPT = """\
You are a biblical scholar creating a participant register for {book_name}.

Structural outline of the book:
{outline}

BHSA linguistic data summary:
{bhsa_summary}

## Person Entities (AUTHORITATIVE — pre-classified from BHSA)

The following entities have been classified as persons/groups by the BHSA linguistic \
database (via the `nametype` feature). Each entity includes: name, english_gloss, \
entity_type, entry_verse, exit_verse, appears_in, and appearance_count.

{person_entities}

## Common Noun Candidates (AUTHORITATIVE — BHSA-extracted lemmas)

The following lemmas were extracted directly from the BHSA. They are the ONLY \
source from which common-noun participant groups/roles may be drawn. Each \
candidate includes: lemma (Hebrew), lemma_ascii, english_gloss, sp \
("subs" / "adjv" / "verb"), appearance_count, top_functions, first_appears, \
sample_appears_in.

This list is filtered to substantives (`sp == "subs"`) so only nominal \
candidates are eligible. Verbs and abstract substantives that do not denote \
human collective roles are processed by other sections of the document.

{common_nouns}

## Output Rules (BHSA-strict)

You MUST produce participant entries ONLY from the two sources below. You MUST \
NOT invent participants that lack a BHSA anchor (proper-noun entity or \
common-noun candidate). Your scholarly enrichment is restricted to the \
descriptive fields explicitly listed for each source (`role_in_book`, \
`relationships`, `what_audience_knows_at_entry`, `arc`, `status_at_end`, and \
`type`).

### Source A — Person Entities (proper nouns)
Create an entry for EACH person entity in the Person Entities list above. \
All entities have already been classified as persons — do not skip any.

For each participant:
- name: copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- english_gloss: copy from the entity data. If empty, provide the English \
translation of the Hebrew name.
- entity_type: copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- type:
  - "named" (DEFAULT) — for any individual proper noun, INCLUDING toponyms \
treated as quasi-named entities (regions, tribal lands, kingdoms). \
Examples of `named`: personal names AND topo­nyms like Judah, Moab, Israel, \
Persia when used as country/region references.
  - "group" — ONLY for proper-noun collectives that explicitly denote a \
plurality of people as a corporate party (e.g., "Israelites", "Moabites" \
as a people). DO NOT use for country/region toponyms.
  - "divine" — for God / YHWH / Almighty / Elohim and divine epithets.
- entry_verse: copy EXACTLY from the entity data (do NOT change)
- exit_verse: copy EXACTLY from the entity data (do NOT change)
- appears_in: copy the ENTIRE appears_in list EXACTLY from the entity data
- appearance_count: copy EXACTLY from the entity data
- role_in_book: their narrative role (protagonist, antagonist, supporting, etc.)
- relationships: list of relationship descriptions
- what_audience_knows_at_entry: what the audience knows when they first appear
- arc: list of {{at: {{chapter, verse}}, state: "description"}} tracking their development
- status_at_end: their state at the book's conclusion

You MUST NOT invent proper-noun participants outside the entity list.

### Source B — Common Noun Groups, Roles, and Officials
For EACH candidate in the Common Noun Candidates list whose `sp == "subs"` \
and whose semantics denote either:

  (a) a HUMAN COLLECTIVE GROUP — a plural/corporate party narratively \
significant in the book (e.g., elders, women of the city, reapers, \
foreigners, nobles, witnesses, the seven sons), OR

  (b) an INSTITUTIONAL ROLE OR OFFICE — a categorial human title that \
identifies a position in the book's social/political/religious system \
(e.g., king, queen, prince, priest, prophet, judge, official, eunuch, \
governor, satrap, lord, foreman, kinsman-redeemer).

create a participant entry. Static fields below MUST be copied EXACTLY \
from the candidate (they are deterministic):
- name: the Hebrew lemma (the `lemma` field) — copy EXACTLY
- english_gloss: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `english_gloss`
- entity_type: "person_common"
- type:
  - "group" for category (a) — collective groups
  - "role" for category (b) — institutional roles/offices
  - "divine" for the divine common noun אלהים (god[s]) when it refers \
to the proper deity. In that case ALSO override entity_type to "person".
- entry_verse: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `first_appears`
- exit_verse: null
- appears_in: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `sample_appears_in`
- appearance_count: copy EXACTLY from the candidate's `appearance_count`
- role_in_book, relationships, what_audience_knows_at_entry, arc, status_at_end: \
your scholarly enrichment based on the narrative

You MUST skip generic kinship terms (אב "father", אם "mother", אח \
"brother", בן "son", בת "daughter") UNLESS the book uses them to form \
a distinct narrative group with a specific role (e.g., "the seven sons \
of X" as a corporate party, "the daughters of Y" as a legal-precedent \
group). Mere familial references that fit any biblical narrative do not \
warrant participant entries.

You MUST NOT invent participants outside the candidate list. Skip candidates \
whose semantics do not denote a human collective group, an institutional \
role, or the divine deity (objects, places, rituals, and abstract concepts \
go to other sections).
